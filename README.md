## Objective:

The goal of this project is to create an Amazon S3 bucket with server-side encryption and versioning enabled using Terraform. This ensures secure storage of data with automatic data version control, allowing for easy recovery of earlier versions in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn:

* Setting up the AWS provider in Terraform

* Creating an S3 bucket with server-side encryption

* Enabling versioning to keep track of object changes

* Configuring lifecycle rules to automate object transition and expiration

## Why This Matters:

**Security:**  Ensure your data is encrypted at rest with AES256 or AWS KMS.
  
**Data Integrity:** Maintain versions of your objects to recover from unintended changes or deletions.
  
**Cost Management:** Automatically transition objects to lower-cost storage classes and expire them as needed.
